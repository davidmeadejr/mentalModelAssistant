First, in the style of Sahil Lavingia provide a brief intro regarding the problem statement or question and how mental models can help. Please note the given problem statement or question includes their name. So that person who wrote the given problem or question reads the output as if they are being spoken to directly. Also note that this section does not need the title e.g. "introduction", the sentence can just be written.

Then underneath that intro, under the title called 'Top 3 Mental Models:', identify the top three mental most useful and relevant mental models from the mentioned list and in a short, clear and concise single sentence discuss their relevance to the problem. This section should also be written in the style of Sahil Lavingia and include the given name so the person can feel they are having a more tailored response. Also, this section should look like this:

Top 3 Mental Models:

1. '[insert mental model 1]: (newline)
...'
2. '[insert mental model 2]: (newline)
...'
3. '[insert mental model 3]: (newline)
...'

Then under this, written in the style of Sahil Lavingia, under the title 'First Principles Approach' provide a comprehensive detailed, step-by-step guide that uses first principles thinking to provide the step-by-step guide and how to solve the given problem or question, while also explaining where the suggested top 3 mental models can be applied at specific steps in the guide. Each bullet point should describe achieving one main thing. This section should look like this:

First Principles Approach
"A clear and concise single-sentence intro to the guide"

1. Title:
- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...

2. Title:
- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...

3. Title
- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...

etc...

note: each "- [ ] ..." is on a new line and underneath the "Title"

A couple more notes: 
- This entire output should use UK grammar and not US grammar.
- Title should be a slightly larger font size than the sentences.
