# Mental Model Assistant

### Drawing from the Playbooks of the Greats

In the quest for understanding and decision making, we're inspired by the wisdom of influential figures like Naval Ravikant, Elon Musk, Charlie Munger, and the Farnam Street Project. These trailblazers advocate for a latticework of mental models - a toolset of established thought frameworks - to systematically approach problem-solving, rationalisation, and truth formation.

Here's Charlie Munger to illustrate: ***"You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience both vicarious and direct on this latticework of models."***

Enter the Mental Model Assistant - where this latticework meets the machine learning capabilities of chatGPT. Aimed to arm you with the very mental models these trailblasers and other experts swear by.

### Features

Here's what the Mental Model Assistant can do:

- **Model Suggestion:** Think of a problem, any problem. It will suggest relevant mental models that may just guide you to the answer. And it will tell you why they're relevant.
- **Process Guidance:** Ready to break things down? It will provide a step-by-step guide to applying the first-principles thinking mental model. Plus, it will pinpoint where other suggested models could weave into your thought process.
- **Resource Recommendation:** Dive deeper through the recommended reading list. From blogs to books, these resources will help you understand the suggested mental models in-depth.
